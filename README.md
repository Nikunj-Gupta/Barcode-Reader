# Introduction

A barcode is an OMR representation of data relating to the object to which it is attached to. Data obtained through barcodes is available rapidly. They are extremely versatile. They avoid possibility of human error.  They also provide better decision making.

A barcode scanner is used to read these barcodes. Most barcode scanners consist of three parts- a illumination system, a sensor and the decoder. In general, a barcode scanner “scans” the black and white elements, of the barcode by illuminating the code with a red light, which is then converted into matching text. More specifically, the sensor in the barcode scanner detects the reflected light from the illumination system (the red light) and generates an analog signal that is sent to the decoder. The decoder interprets that signal, validates the barcode using the check digit, and coverts it into text. There are different types of barcode scanners. Some of them are- pen-type reader, camera-based reader, CCD reader, Laser scanner, etc.

We have made a prototype of a Pen-type Barcode reader.
